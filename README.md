### 4. **Deploy as Web Service** (Advanced)
If you want a true web solution, consider:

- **Google Apps Script** with Google Docs API
- **Microsoft Graph API** (requires Office 365)
- **LibreOffice in Docker** on a cloud server

## Quick Win:
For now, I'd recommend **Option 2** - create the GitHub repo with your current script and clear instructions. Most users who need this functionality will have Word available.

Would you like me to help you set up any of these alternatives?
